*“Its, uh, _style_, man.  _Style_ is everything. _Style_ is not to be, uh, confused with _class_. A Mercedes Benz is _class_, because it represents money. However, chilly dogs have absolutely no _class_, but a great deal of _style_. And punk rock, new wave, what ever you have, uh, reggae, rasta fari hair cuts, what have you, are all different kinds of _styles_. None of them have any class. I got _class_.”*
**- David Lee Roth, 1983**
